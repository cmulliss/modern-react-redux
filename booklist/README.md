# Booklist

* our App state is generated by reducer fns
* BooksReducer always returns an [] of books
* The [] contains a list of objects, where each object represents one book
*  we added the BooksReducer to our combined reducer call inside the reducers index file
* this reducer adds a key to our global App state, called books, where the key is 'books' and the value is whatever gets returned from the books reducer, which is this case is our array of books
* created a container BookList, as needed to be aware of state within the redux app
* we promoted it to a container by importing 'connect' fn, then defined mapStateToProps and we hooked our commponent together with mapStateToProps using the connect fn
* added <BookList /> to App
* redux generated a state object that contained our books, then mapped that state as props to our component because the state was updated through our reducer and re-rendered with the list of books

## action creators and dispatch etc

* bindActionCreators with dispatch, going to take all the actions and make sure they get passed on to all the different reducers

```javascript
  return bindActionCreators({ selectBook: selectBook }, dispatch)
```

* mapDispatch to props, anything returned from this will end up as __props__ on the BookList container.
* we are passing an object with key and value 'selectBook'
* whatever we pass as the first argument is going to be available as props to our container
* can specifically call this.props.selectBook (the key)
* __and that will call our action creator__

```javascript
function mapDispatchToProps (dispatch) {
  // whenever selectBook is called, the result should be
  // passed to all of our reducers
  return bindActionCreators({ selectBook: selectBook }, dispatch)
}
```

* mapStateToProps will promote BookList from a component to a container
* it needs to know about this new dispatch method, selectBook, make it available as a prop

### summary

* want to take some state and map it to the props of our container
* and want to take the action creator and make it available to be called inside the container as well
* selectBook is a totally plain fn, returns a plain js object
* if we just call it, we get the object back inside our component
* so, the purpose of bindActionCreators and dispatch is specifically to take what gets returned from selectBook and make sure it flows through all the reducers


* all reducers get 2 arguments, current state and an action
*
