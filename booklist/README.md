# Booklist

* our App state is generated by reducer fns
* BooksReducer always returns an [] of books
* The [] contains a list of objects, where each object represents one book
*  we added the BooksReducer to our combined reducer call inside the reducers index file
* this reducer adds a key to our global App state, called books, where the key is 'books' and the value is whatever gets returned from the books reducer, which is this case is our array of books
* created a container BookList, as needed to be aware of state within the redux app
* we promoted it to a container by importing 'connect' fn, then defined mapStateToProps and we hooked our commponent together with mapStateToProps using the connect fn
* added <BookList /> to App
* redux generated a state object that contained our books, then mapped that state as props to our component because the state was updated through our reducer and re-rendered with the list of books
